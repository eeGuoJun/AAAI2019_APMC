Note 1:
The example feature dataset is "3Sources", which is 
kindly provided by Menglei Hu (ml.hu@nuaa.edu.cn).
Users can directly run 'Demo_3Sources.m' on MATLAB.
Results displayed in command window are one-time, which is 
influenced by random initialization in k-means clustering. 
Note 2:
For other datasets, we also recommend to normalize data.
Please refer to our manuscript and code for more details.
